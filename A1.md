# First Application: KIJIJI
**Link to application:** [kijiji canada](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ebay.kijiji.ca&hl=en)

Kijiji is an application which can be used to buy and sell various kinds of used and new items, starting from cars to mobile phones. This application helps to locate the seller along with seller’s email id with which seller can be contacted. The buyer can negotiate with seller and buy the item buyer is interested in. This application is helpful for new international students as they can find rented apartments, buy used laptops and mobile phones. I have been using this application to a greater extent, since I have been to Canada.
This application uses GPS to locate the city of user. User can also post ad by using camera application in the mobile phone. This is very convenient as all mobile phones have the camera application and it is easy to take a pic of item and upload them in the application. For a buyer, it is easy to search items he/she wants to buy, as there is an option named “Browse Categories” in the first page of application. By going through the various categories listed in the application, buyer can shortlist items he/she wants to buy. There is also a “refine” option using which the items can be further shortlisted based on price and make. There is also a search button provided for users who directly want to search for item. This can save some time if we do not know which category the item searched belongs to. If a user is regular visitor of the application, it remembers what was searched in previous visits and it shows the items in the future visits. This saves a lot of time for users who are visiting the application to find an item but fail to locate in previous visits. According to me, the application is built keeping all users in mind. Hence, I feel the design of application is matured enough for a user to keep using it after his/her first visit.
One improvement I can see here is, if there is a spelling mistake in the item we entered, the search results in saying “No item found”. An improvement can be made by either matching nearest item to the spelling or give options by auto-correcting the item (as done by Google).

## First Heuristic Evaluation: Aesthetic and minimalistic design ##
Please check the first screenshot. It is a very simple interface on the first page, where users can easily locate the options available. For a seller, the option is to press “Post an Ad!”
 button and for a buyer the option is to either “Search Kijiji” or “Browse Categories”

## Second Heuristic Evaluation: Flexibility and efficiency of use ##
Please check the second screenshot. The “Recently searched” items are displayed in the following visits. This will help user to locate the items he/she is searching for.

# Second Application: Evernote #
**Link to application:** [Evernote](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.evernote&hl=en)

Evernote is a wonderful application where we can save a lot of information and it can be accessed from any mobile device or laptop. It asks the user to create a login which can be used later, on various devices to access information we have stored. Normally, I prefer to make notes of different information which I can access even on my laptop or different mobile phone.

Evernote gives us various options to mark the files as simple text files, handwritten notes and also save a picture by taking a photo from mobile camera. I normally save any kind of interesting information such as restaurant details in various cities, the beautiful holiday destinations, health related information and so on. The most important advantage of this application is, as mentioned above, we can access these saved items from any place, any other device. One of the efficient use of this application is when we change our mobile phone. Normally, we transfer all our pictures, audio and video files along with contact information. But, other important information such as text notes are difficult to transfer. This application will make it very simple to perform this task. On the new mobile phone, we can install this application and login using the credentials. We get all the files and information from old phone on new phone. I feel this is the easiest way to transfer some of the files such as text files.
The user interface is also very simple to use, hence anyone without the knowledge of the application can start using this application right away. The options are self-explanatory.

## First Heuristic Evaluation: Error Prevention ##
If a user tries to save an empty file, it gives an error explaining “can’t save an empty file”. I tried taking a screenshot of this, but it just comes as a flash message and it disappears.

## Second Heuristic Evaluation: Visibility of system status ##
Appropriate feedback is given while using this application. For example, if we select hand written notes to be saved, it also gives an option of adding texts using keyboard. This message is displayed accurately. Please find the screenshot below.
